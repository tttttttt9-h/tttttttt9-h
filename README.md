# Hey, there!
I'm SiHwan Lee, an AWS-focused cloud computing student aiming to become a Site Reliability Engineer.

I’m driven by understanding how real systems scale, fail, and stay reliable.

I learn best by building systems, pushing them to their limits, and improving them.

I’m continuously learning and challenging myself to become a better engineer.

### Fun Facts:
- I aim to become an AWS expert.
- I often study while listening to Chuu’s music. 💗
- I am learning Japanese with the goal of working in Japan.
- I am based in South Korea.
